## Team
Zen Acar, Gina Cameras, Harini Rao, Carlos Santillan

## Topic
Our team will create a dashboard to visualize US unemployment trends to understand how COVID has affected unemployment for the following dimensions
* State
* Age
* Gender
* Industry

## Datasets
* State level unemployment data (2015 - Present)
  - https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp (weekly | # of claims)
* Industry level unemployment data
   - https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ (monthly | # of people unemployed)
* Demographic level unemployment data
   - https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ln/ (monthly | # of people unemployed)

## Who is counted as unemployed?
Source: https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm
* All those who did not have a job at all during the survey reference week, made at least one specific active effort to find a job during the prior 4 weeks, and were available for work (unless temporarily ill).
* All those who were not working and were waiting to be called back to a job from which they had been laid off. (They need not be looking for work to be classified as unemployed.)
